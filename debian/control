Description: side-scrolling dogfighting game
 Triplane Classic is a side-scrolling dogfighting game featuring solo
 missions and multiplayer mode with up to four players. It is a port
 of the original Triplane Turmoil game for DOS and aims to match the
 original game exactly so that high scores remain comparable to the
 original.
